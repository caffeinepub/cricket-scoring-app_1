Users must be able to paste a newline-separated or comma-separated list of player names into a text area, or upload a plain-text (.txt) or CSV file, and have all valid names added as players to the selected team in one action. Each parsed name should be validated (non-empty, not duplicate within the team, team does not exceed 11 players). Show a preview of parsed names before confirming, and display a summary of how many players were added or skipped with reasons.",

Primary backgrounds and headers should use deep navy/dark blue tones. Accent colors, highlights, active states, buttons, and key data values should use bold orange. Neutral surfaces should use light grey-white. Update Tailwind config color tokens, CSS custom properties in index.css, and all component-level color classes (Teams page, BottomTabNavigation, Layout header, scoring dashboard, scorecard, match history, match setup, rules page, and modals) to consistently reflect the new blue-and-orange palette. Typography, spacing, and layout density should be refined to feel more professional and polished — clean sans-serif body text, sharp card borders, elevated shadows, and well-defined section hierarchy.",
