      "featureTitle": "Diagnose and fix the scoring regression in LiveScoring.tsx where recording deliveries (runs, extras, wickets) has stopped functioning correctly. Ensure that every valid delivery type — normal runs (0–6), wides, no-balls, byes, leg-byes, and wickets — is correctly recorded, updates the score display, advances the over/ball count, and persists both to localStorage and the backend. The fix must not reintroduce the EndOfOverModal infinite bowler-selection loop resolved in Version 20.",
