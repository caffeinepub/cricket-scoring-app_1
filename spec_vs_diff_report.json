  "summary": "The diff implements both REQ-1 (auto-end innings on over completion) and REQ-2 (fix total score display). REQ-1 is addressed via a pendingInningsEnd ref in LiveScoring.tsx that triggers after EndOfOverModal closes, with navigation to scorecard for 2nd innings end and EndOfInningsModal for 1st innings end. REQ-2 is addressed via the computeTotalRunsFromDeliveries utility used in ScoreDisplay, LiveScoring, and Scorecard. Both requirements appear substantially implemented based on the diff evidence.",
