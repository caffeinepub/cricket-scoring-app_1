  "summary": "Both REQ-14 (bulk player upload) and REQ-15 (blue/orange retheme) are largely implemented. REQ-14 has a complete BulkPlayerUploadModal with file upload, textarea input, preview, validation, and summary. REQ-15 has comprehensive theme changes across all major files. However, there are some gaps: the Scorecard page theme updates are only referenced via file summaries, and the WicketModal, EndOfInningsModal, EndOfOverModal modal theming cannot be directly verified from the truncated diffs.",

      "reason": "The diff does not include direct content of WicketModal, EndOfInningsModal, or EndOfOverModal files. While LiveScoring.tsx imports them, their internal theming cannot be confirmed from the available diff.
